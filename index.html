                            Hello, and thank you for checking out my website! I'm driven by a relentless desire to learn new things and experience new adventures, 
                            which has led me to some interesting careers and places throughout my life. My hope is this website accurately captures and portrays 
                            the sense of excitement and search for knowledge I've experienced.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm currently working for an online education company in Scottsdale, Arizona, where I've been for the past 11 years. 
                            My company creates a complete online curriculum for grades K-12, which is sold to school districts across the United States,
                            either as a remedial solution, or as a stand-alone curriculum alternative. I started with the company on the English Language Arts team,
                            creating and editing class curriculum and working directly with the on-screen teachers. I've since transitioned to the Customization
                            and Alignments team - our primary responsibility is researching various state standards and customizing our curriculum specifically
                            for state and client needs. Our company has a large software engineering team, and although I've worked briefly with many of the programmers
                            on specific projects, I'm very interested to increase my programming skills in order to eventually transition to a position with that team.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I live in Gilbert, Arizona (about a 25 minute commute to work one-way with no traffic) with my wife, our three-year-old son, and a six-month-old
                            foster baby boy. We also tolerate an old, cranky cat who likes to ignore us in between eating, sleeping, and pooping. In my spare time (ha!),
                            I enjoy playing guitar, working on cars and projects around the house, and playing with the boys.
